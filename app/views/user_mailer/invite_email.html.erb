<h1>Welcome to GOPTrade, <%= @user.name %></h1>

<p>
  You can get access to the site by clicking the link below (it logs you in automatically).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="<%= @url %>">gop-trade.herokuapp.com</a>
</p>

<p>As long as you use the same browser, you'll always be logged in. If you need to get
access on a different device or browser, use the link there. Don't forward this link because
that will end up causing other people to trade with your shares.</p>

<p>Remember, you don't have to hold all your shares until the end of the season or sell everyone
that you don't think can win. You can buy shares in a candidate just because you think they'll
temporarily rise in price only to sell them later. Since you already own shares in each candidate,
can sell the straight off the bat. Everyone starts with 10 shares in each candidate
and $10 in GOP Bucks.</p>

<p>Let's get trading!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Love, Justin :)</p>
